## Work Experience
**Senior Research Engineer @ ABS (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Engineered chatbots based on ABS rules and guides
  - Developed the chatbot by integrating ABS published rules and guides with vector embedding algorithms.
  - Utilized LangChain frameworks to implement fine-tune and Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods with LLM models (Llama 3 nd GPT-4).

- Developed and productionized ABS AI Corrosion Detection tool
  - Built data pipelines for data ingestion, data validation, data transformation, model training, model evaluation and model prediction.
  - Applied PSPNet architecture with DenseNet as encoder and Statial Pyramid as decoder for the image semantic segmentation.
  - Conduct end-to-end MLOps and integrated MLflow for the model tracking. Dockerized the model and used GitHub Actions to build CICD pipelines.
  - Results reveals it graded the imagery with 98.9% accuracy. [ABS AI Corrosion Detectionâ„¢](https://ww2.eagle.org/en/news/press-room/partnership-ai-enabled-corrosion-detection.html)

**Research Engineer @ ABS (_July 2014 - June 2022_)**
- Developed and deployed ML models to predict vessels' fuel consumption
  - Built pipelines for data extraction and transformation as a baseline for keeping data robust and clean.
  - Fine-tuned hyperparameters for various models, including elastic net regression, random forest, gradient boosting for regression and deep learning neural network.
  - Integrated MLflow for model selection. Developed an API app with selected model using FastAPI framework. Dockerized the API app and deploy it to AWS.

**Graduate research @ Georgia Institute of Technology (_Sep 2019 - May 2022_)**
- Performed weakly supervised machine learning to detect bullying SMS messages
  - Performed 4-BERT based pre-trained NLP models to the selected texts.
  - Design scoring function with the 4 model's results, then apply it to filter out over 1 million conversations out of the raw SMS dataset.
  - Trained CatBoost, DistilBERT and DNN models on the filtered conversations.

- Created a tool to supplement Airbnb booking process
  - Performed sentiment analysis based on the 840k customer reviews to rate each unit's features (e.g., number of beds, location, cleanness, price)
  - Present the above aspect-based sentiment analysis results on Radar Chart to allow users to conduct a multi-dimensional comparison of selected features.
